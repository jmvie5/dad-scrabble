My kid had this set of 26 wooden cubes, with each letter from A to Z.

I was playing with it and wondered what is the biggest Scrabble grid I can do with only one of each letter.

You can try too with this game!

P.S. This game will not check if you input real words. If you want to play fair respect the rules of Scrabble.
